    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
      This is a two player game where the blue player is to use the arrow keys while the grey player is to use the 'w, a, s and d' to navigate through the map.  The goal is to be the first player to collect 15 points.  Points are earned by running over the randomly appearing balls.  There are two power ups available that will remain on screen until a point is scored.  The power ups will increase speed or height depending on which player earns the power up.
